# WONRIAL ENTERPRISES LTD

- Production domain: [wonrial.com](https://wonrial.com)
- Development domains:
  - ReactJS + React Router DOM: [yurapa.github.io](https://yurapa.github.io)
  - ReactJS + NextJS [wonrial.vercel.app](https://wonrial.vercel.app/)

### Packages:

- i18next - Internationalization
- react-icons - icons for the fast development
- tailwind (postcss, autoprefixer) - utility-first CSS framework
- next-themes - an abstraction for themes in your Next.js app

### Theme:
inspired by these two themes:
- [Crypto](https://uideck.com/templates/crypto-tailwind/)
- [Startup](https://nextjstemplates.com/templates/startup)
- [Startup Pro](https://nextjstemplates.com/templates/saas-starter-startup)

### Multilingual / Internationalization:

In this project, I use a path-based strategy to determine the locale of our web application. Implementing this strategy in Next.js is easy because the framework follows a convention for creating paths. I created a [locale] folder and place all our pages inside it.
