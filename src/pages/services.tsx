          <h3>Software development. Architecture and design of complex systems for your business</h3>
          <p>
            Custom software development is the process of designing, building, integrating, scaling, and upgrading
            software solutions to address the pressing needs or achieve objectives of your specific business.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h3>Design for interactive web applications</h3>
          <p>
            An interactive web design is a design for websites which uses other inbuilt software, modules or features
            aimed at creating an environment for a website or web application user to be actively engaged during visit
            or use as the case may be, thereby improving his or her user experience (UX).
          </p>

          <p>
            Having prior knowledge of your expected users’ profile and their presumed preferences enables the web
            design’s interactivity to accommodate them. For example, users that do not want to spend much time on your
            site should not be made to do so. Rather make it simpler for them to get the much-needed information as fast
            as possible. Such users abandon transactions or site visits when they don’t achieve their aims in a shorter
            time.

          <h3>Integration of electronic payment systems</h3>
          <p>
            Consumers want convenience; it’s one of the reasons that online shopping continues to grow in popularity. A
            study by BigCommerce found that eCommerce is increasing 23 percent year over year. Moreover, Millennials and
            Gen Xers — two generations who make up the majority of the U.S. population — spend six hours per week
            shopping online.
